/**
 * The engine that is being used to parse and process the scripts. I decided to go with an engine because originally
 * this was going to be a text game engine, then it turned into a scripting language parser. I am keeping the term "engine"
 * and using it to describe the parser and processor functionality of this API. If you would like to use this in any way,
 * you can use the {@link Engine#LOGGER} to log to something. You can use {@link Engine#stateOfEngine} to check if the
 * program as an argument passed in called <em>-debug</em> which will print every step of the process out. Of course,
 * you would have to do it something like at lines <em>27-29</em>. There is also a global script loader which is used to
 * get the active script loader. I am thinking about making the script loader have a <em>close()</em> method so that
 * when one script loader has been used and it is time to load up a new script loader, then one can close while another opens
 * and we can add it to the <bold>Engine</bold>'s global script loader.
